pyfix
=====

A small but usable FIX (Financial Information eXchange) engine written in python.

Currently targeting FIX4.4.

The purpose of the project is to have a FIX engine suitable for amatuer/hobbiest usage, not full compliance with the FIX protocol.

The engine is written in Python 3 using the asyncio framework.
