pyfix
=====

Pyfix is still very much a work in progress. The goal is to have it be a small but usable FIX (Financial Information eXchange) engine written in python. The purpose of the engine is to handle the FIX protocol logic and overhead between a financial exchange and local trading application or interface.

Pyfix is intended to be suitable for amatuer/hobbiest usage, not necessarily full compliance with the FIX protocol. I am currently targeting FIX4.4.

The engine is written in Python 3 using the asyncio framework.
